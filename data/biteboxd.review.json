    "title": "Good meal but one try is enough!",
    "body": "I had an amazing experience here! The food was exquisite, and the service was impeccable. The ambiance was cozy and inviting. I highly recommend trying their signature dishes, especially the seafood pasta. Will definitely be returning! However, I think it is important to note that for some people, the taste may not be good. It's a little bit spicy due to the pepper they add on the toppings. You may ask ate not to put any if spicy is not your thing.",

    "body": "This is now my new go-to resto! Not the best but you get what you paid for. The service is a little slow but ate is so nice and accommodating. Price is cheaper compared to other resto nearby. The ambiance is also great and their choice of music is good. It's very amazing. Many Lasallians would love this resto. Try it guys! You would love this if you are a huge fan of Taylor Swift.",
